# HTAN Phase 2 Data Model (HTAN2)

---

## ⚠️ **DO NOT USE – UNDER DEVELOPMENT** ⚠️  

This data model is in **active development**. It builds on **HTAN Phase 1** and incorporates input from the **Cancer Data Standards (CDS)** initiative. Expect frequent changes until a stable version is released.

## Overview  
The **HTAN Phase 2 (HTAN2)** data model aims to enhance data interoperability within cancer research. It uses **LinkML** to define structured data representation, integrating new requirements from the evolving cancer research community.

This repository is part of ongoing efforts to refine and standardize the HTAN2 data model. For the current Phase 1 model, refer to the [HTAN data-models repository](https://github.com/ncihtan/data-models).
