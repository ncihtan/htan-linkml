# Add Clinical Module to Data Model

## Changes Made
- Added Clinical module with comprehensive schema for clinical data
- Added test data demonstrating schema usage
- Enhanced Participant module with additional demographic fields
- Implemented comprehensive test suite for both Clinical and Participant modules
- Added detailed development documentation and quickstart guides
- Improved build system and CI workflow
- Fixed schema path dependencies in Makefile

## Schema Features
- Defines clinical data classes including:
  - Diagnosis information
  - Exposure history
  - Family history
  - Follow-up observations
  - Molecular test results
  - Therapy information
- Includes comprehensive enums for standardized values
- Links to standard ontologies (NCIT, UBERON)
- Enhanced Participant schema with:
  - Demographic fields (race, ethnicity, gender, sex)
  - Vital status tracking
  - Physical measurements
  - Location information

## Documentation
- Added comprehensive development guide (`docs/development.md`) covering:
  - Local development setup
  - Testing procedures
  - CI workflow testing
  - Project structure
  - Common development tasks
  - Troubleshooting guide
  - Best practices
- Added quickstart guide (`docs/quickstart.md`) with:
  - Common commands
  - Setup instructions
  - Testing workflows
  - Common issues and solutions
  - Project structure overview

## Build System Improvements
- Updated Makefile to use correct schema paths
- Fixed example generation dependencies
- Improved module-specific build rules
- Enhanced test execution workflow
- Added proper documentation handling in .gitignore

## Testing
âœ… Validated schema and test data using LinkML validator:
```bash
linkml-validate -s modules/Clinical/clinical_schema.yaml --target-class ClinicalData modules/Clinical/test_data.yaml
```
Test passed successfully with no validation issues, confirming:
- Schema syntax is correct
- Test data conforms to all schema constraints
- Import paths are working correctly

## Test Coverage
- Added unit tests for both Clinical and Participant modules
- Implemented validation tests for:
  - Required fields
  - Data type constraints
  - Enum value validation
  - Complex nested structures
- Added test data examples for:
  - Valid cases demonstrating proper usage
  - Invalid cases testing validation rules
  - Edge cases and error conditions
- All tests passing locally and in CI

## CI/CD Improvements
- Fixed CI workflow to properly handle schema paths
- Added local CI testing capabilities
- Improved test execution in CI environment
- Enhanced documentation generation workflow

## Future Considerations
- Consider adding more specific test cases for edge conditions
- May want to add documentation for common validation patterns
- Could expand test coverage for specific clinical scenarios
- Consider adding automated documentation generation
- May want to add more detailed schema validation rules
